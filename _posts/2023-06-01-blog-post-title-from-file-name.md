## Unveiling the Enigmatic Brainfuck

When scrolling through my instagram feed, I stumbled upon a post from one of the members of my favorite Georgian hip-hop group. To my surprise, he shared a snippet of code in an esoteric programming language called Brainfuck. this caught my attention immediately, as I had heard about Brainfuck somewhere before, but had never delved into it. And wtf even is esoteric programming language?

So, we know how there are different programming languages like Python, Java, or C++ that people use to write computer programs? yeah, so an esoteric programming language is a bit different from those mainstream languages. It's like a special category of programming languages that are designed to be strange and quirky and sometimes to not make any sense at first glance.

These programming languages are not really meant to be practical or widely used for everyday programming tasks. Instead, they are created as a way to explore unusual ideas or to challenge traditional programming concepts. You can think of them as more of a fun and creative experiment rather than something you'd use to build a real-world application.

After some googling, I found out that, Brainfuck was created by a programmer named Urban Müller back in 1993. Müller designed BrainFuck with the intention of making it as minimalistic as possible. the language consists of only eight commands: +, -, >, <, ., ,, [, and ]. Still not sure why he wanted to do that. Some say that he wanted to implement smallest possible compiler.(maybe)


#### Hello World 

```
++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++.>+.+++++++..+++.>++.<<++++
++++++++++.>.+++.------.--------.>+.>.

```

####  Fibonacci Sequence 
not sure if it is actually correct tho.
```
++++++++++>+>+++++++[<<++++++++++>>-]>[<+>-]++++++++++[>++++++++++<-]>.

```

#### So?

Idk, go and explore BrainFuck if you got interested. I probs won't be learning BrainFuck in much details but there are more esoteric languages that I will be checking out soon.
